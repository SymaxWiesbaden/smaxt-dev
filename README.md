Welcome to smaxt, the completely into an ORACLE™ database integrated production system for data-based Office documents[\[1\]](#_ftn1).

It is estimated that, based on numerous reporting and BI projects, that between 40% and 60% \(in some cases even up to 100%\) of the reports generated by those reporting and BI tools, are simply used to convert data into Microsoft Excel™ workbooks, in Microsoft PowerPoint™ presentations, and also in Microsoft Word™ documents.

This is usually done by performing the relevant reports and then manually using the export function to transfer the results in a .xlsx file. Sometimes, the only way to achieve this is using the Clipboard via copy & paste.

smaxt, however, is a directly in the ORACLE database integrated solution, that produces the desired Office™ documents perfect, immediately and without any intermediate steps.
