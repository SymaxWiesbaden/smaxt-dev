# Getting started

In this section you learn, how to create the first simple report with smaxt. You will see how you can easily create simple Excel documents with smaxt.

At this point, we are deliberately refraining from showing you the additional advanced features of smaxt, such as

* parameterization, 
* iteration quantities, 
* user rights,
* job control etc. 

These are discussed in detail in the following section "Understanding smaxt", together with all other features.

Although the following steps produce only a simple Excel report, the procedure is still a good entry point because the smaxt objects generated in this process can be extended and refined.

## Run Excel

After installing the smaxt Excel add-in, it is loaded automatically every time you Excel. Therefore you will find the additional entry "smaxt" in the menu ribbon:
