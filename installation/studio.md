## smaxt Management Studio

The smaxt Management Studio smaxtUI offers full control to the smaxt system - from the data modules over parameterization to rights and roles as well as production planning.

### System Requirements

smaxt Management Studio requires Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 as well as .NET-Framework 4.5.[^1] For the application files 20 MB of free disk space are required at least.

### Download und Installation

#### 1. Download the archive

Download the archive `setup_smaxt_Management_Studio_V2.0_de.zip` from www.smaxt.com, or detach the archive from the mail, which you received together with the license information and store the file in a directory of the target computer.

#### 2. Unpack the archive

Open a shell and unpack the archive:

`unzip setup_smaxt_Management_Studio_V2.0_de.zip`

After unpacking, you find the setup-routine in the directory.  
 Run it and follow instructions on the screen to install the smaxt Management Studio.

**Note  
: **

> The installer checks, if the required .NET-Frameworks is already present on the target computer.  
>  If not, a dialogue appears, which prompts you to decide to cancel installation or try to install the required .NET-Framework automatically.  
>  Keep in mind, that after .NET installation, a reboot of the computer is absolutely necessary, otherwise the smaxt-application will not work properly.



[^1]: Download of .NET-Frameworks 4.5: [http://www.microsoft.com/de-DE/download/details.aspx?id=42642](http://www.microsoft.com/de-DE/download/details.aspx?id=42642) \(Take care, that the complete .NET Framework "Full profile" will be installed, as for "Client Profile" does not fit for execution of smaxt\)
